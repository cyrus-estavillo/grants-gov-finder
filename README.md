I'm not going to add a super long README here but shoutout to @ericmuckley on GitHub for laying the groundwork which allowed me to make this. 
Definitely have to give most of the credit to him, I just adapted it to work for my purposes and fixed some issues which prevented it from working with the new grants.gov zip files.
Here is his repo to reference and understand how to schedule the bot to run automatically for you: https://github.com/ericmuckley/foa-finder
